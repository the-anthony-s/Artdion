## Update comments -> Real-time
* if user deleted -> show comment, but display user as [deleted] without the link to profile
* if user presents, but comment deleted -> show message [comment was deleted]

## Problems
* what if the user deleted an account? What to do with comments? Likes? Followers?

## Talks
* locole content only. If English -> show english talks, if Russian -> show russian talks

## Create notifications
* notifications for user
* check all replies, new likes, comments, billings
* allow user to control notifications

## Else
* remove comments_count from photos
* add comments_likes_count, photos_likes_count -> user
